# Spinners
This repository contains the code that I covered in **[my tutorials on Spinners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmkb5CTw5rTQ4bjWZdOQbrHPsZexcdef)**.
It contains code for addding Spinners to your Android app, along with providing a custom Spinner layout, getting the selected item &amp; more. 

It is based on a tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmkb5CTw5rTQ4bjWZdOQbrHPsZexcdef
